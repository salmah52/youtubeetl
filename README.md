# YouTube Data ETL with Airflow

## Project Overview

The **YouTube Data ETL with Airflow** project is an end-to-end data pipeline designed to automate the extraction, transformation, and loading of data from YouTube channels. It integrates with the YouTube Data API, extracts data, processes it, and allows you to choose a destination for storage, which can include Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or other storage solutions.

## Project Components

This project is comprised of several key components, each playing a crucial role in ensuring the data from YouTube channels is efficiently processed and organized. The main components include:

- **Data Extraction:** Leveraging the YouTube Data API, this component fetches data from specific YouTube channels. You can select the channels you want to collect data from.

- **Data Transformation:** The extracted data is transformed into a structured format suitable for analysis. This may include cleaning, parsing, or aggregating data as needed.

- **Data Loading:** Once the data is prepared, you can choose the destination for storage, including cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage.

- **Airflow Integration:** This project is integrated with Apache Airflow, allowing for scheduled or trigger-based ETL jobs. Airflow helps automate and orchestrate the entire pipeline.

- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling mechanisms are in place to ensure the pipeline gracefully handles exceptions and provides clear notifications of any issues.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project include:

- Automating the collection of data from YouTube channels of your choice.
- Ensuring the collected data is clean, structured, and ready for analysis.
- Allowing flexibility in choosing the destination for storing the data.
- Implementing an efficient and reliable ETL process that can be scheduled and monitored.
- Providing a framework for expanding the ETL process and customizing it as per your specific requirements.

Now, let's dive into the details of setting up and using this project.
